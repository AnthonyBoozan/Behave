# Behave

This app is designed to help parents/guardian figures to keep track of children behavior. It allows you to give out "tokens" as a 
positive or negative reinforcment and the tokens accumulate to the guardian giving out a reward based on the one the child wants if
it is positive or the parent may choose the negative reward. 

This app uses jfreechart to chart the accumulation of tokens and the app also allows for a timer to be set to auto give a token to a 
child over a certain period of time.
